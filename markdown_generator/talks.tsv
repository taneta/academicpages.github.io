Grandmotherâ€™s neuron	Installation	talk3	VSS Demo Night	2018-05-21	St. Pete Beach, Florida, US	https://www.visionsciences.org/2018-demo-night/	If we could find a grandma cell, what kind of information would this cell code? Artificial neural networks allow us to study l atent representations which activate neurons. I choose a unit with the highest selectivity for grandmother images and visualize a percept which drives this neuron.
