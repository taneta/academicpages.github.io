Understanding how information is coded, transferred and stored in the brain is an essential part of neuroscience. The property of invariant recognition, one of the fundamental characteristics of human visual system, has been observed in deep neural networks, providing exceptional results in object recognition tasks. Here, I show how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used to study latent representations, coded by neurons in high visual areas. To explain neural preferences, I train a deep network to simulate the response of the neurons in the Inferior temporal (IT) cortex of macaque monkey. The model has high performance and explain > 0.65% of the variance in the neural data. I visualize latent representations of artificial neurons using a generative adversarial network. The approach allows to find an input signal that maximizes activation of an individual unit without limitations introduced by a dataset.
