Education
======
* Ph.D in Physiology of Vision, Pavlov Institute of Physiology, 2014 - now (in progress)
* M.S. in Cognitive Sciences, St.Petersburg State University, 2014
* Specialist degree in Management, St.Petersburg State University, 2009

Work experience
======

* JUL 2014 - NOW: Ph.D. Student, Research Assistant
  * Pavlov Institute of Physiology
  * Ph.D. thesis topic: “Information processing in higher-order areas of the visual cortex.”
  * In our laboratory, I lead works on data analysis and deep learning. Some of my projects:
  ** Visualization of information encoded by neurons using GANs:
  *** Developed an approach for visualization of latent representations encoded by neurons using generative networks. Implemented a system for short-loop integration of neural response with the generative approach. 
  ** Segmentation of pathologies on OCT retinal scans:
  *** Implemented a compact convolutional neural network for segmentation of Pigment epithelial detachment regions using loosely-labeled data.
  ** Estimation of gaze direction based on webcam data:
  *** Enhanced the prediction of gaze direction based on webcam data by including temporal information.
  ** Text perception:
  *** Developed a tool for text analysis (natural language processing - syntactic structure analysis,  segmentation of regions containing text on images) and conducted experiments on text perception.

  * Supervisor: Shelepin Yuri
  
* DEC 2015 - APR 2017: Part-time researcher
  * Brain Science Institute, RIKEN, Tokyo, Japan 
  * In Tanifuju’s lab, I studied the effect of priming information during face detection task: created a dataset set of faces and objects, preprocessed the images, implemented an experimental software, conducted a preliminary study. Another project I started during my exchange program and continued remotely afterward was about the functional similarities in information processing in monkey’s Inferior temporal cortex and deep layers of Convolutional neural networks. 
  * Supervisor: Tanifuji Manabu

Service and leadership
======
* I am excited about AI and science, and the positive impact that can be produced by applying state-of-the-art technologies in other domains. To share this attitude, I organize events and give public lectures about vision, neuroscience and machine learning. I was a founder of  “Science and Technology” and “Machine Learning Gym” communities in Tokyo (with a total audience > 1400 people), where I invited scientists and engineers to give talks and held free hackathon-classes helping participants to acquire practical skills in machine learning and data analysis.
