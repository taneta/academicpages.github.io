## Hi, I'm Katerina
### I study visual perception in biological and artificial systems

<div style="text-align: justify">

<p>My research focuses on understanding how objects and events of the outside world, which a living being experiences through its sensors, form abstract representations in the nervous system. How these are then stored and used to ensure the survival and effective functioning of an organism. </p>
<p>I explore principles underlie mentioned processes in the context of the <b><em>visual system</em></b>. Specifically, I target late stages of visual processing, where object and face recognition happens.</p>
<p>At the same time, I pay as much attention to systems of <b><em>computer vision</em></b> for two main reasons. First, due to a number of observable similarities between biological systems and artificial neural networks, the latter can be conveniently used for the purpose of vision perception modelling. Second, because such networks are widespred in both academia and industry, it is important to understand what are the differences and limitations in the way they perform recognition in comparison to the human visual system. Thus, I investigate how artificial neural networks form high-level representations and how the representations determine decision process.</p>
