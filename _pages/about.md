I study visual perception in humans and machines
------

My research focuses on understanding how objects and events of the outside world, which a living being experience through its sensors, form abstract representations in the nervous system. How they are then stored and used. I explore principles underlie these processes on the example of the visual system. Specifically, I target late stages visual processing, where neurons tuned to respond to complex images performing object recognition.

At the same time, I pay as much attention to systems of computer vision for two main reasons. First, because of some seen similarities between biological systems and artificial neural networks, the latter can be conveniently used models. Second, because we rely on artificial models in many respects, we should understand how different they are and what are their limitations. Thus, the way visual signal is processed in artificial neural networks to form high-level representations and later during decision process  is no less important.
