## Hello there,

### I study visual perception in biological and artificial systems

<div style="text-align: justify">

<p>My research focuses on understanding how objects and events of the outside world that a living being experiences through its sensors are represented in the nervous system.  How these representations are stored and used to ensure the survival and effective functioning of an organism. And how the structure of the system shapes the perception.</p>
<p>I explore principles underlie mentioned processes in the context of the <b><em>visual system</em></b>. Specifically, I target late stages of visual processing, where the recognition of complex objects and faces happens.</p>
<p>On the other side, I pay as much attention to <b><em>artificial systems</em></b> for two main reasons. First, due to a number of observed similarities between biological systems and artificial neural networks, the latter can be conveniently used as models of visual perception. Second, the wide application of systems of computer vision models makes it important to understand the differences between the models and human visual perception. Thus, I investigate how artificial neural networks form high-level representations and how such representations determine their decision process.</p>
